L. Minio-Paluello in <i>DSB</i> 1. 267&ndash;81 (on tradition and influence).
  Indexing Aristotle's works presents difficulties at several levels. He
wrote a great deal. The sources provide evidence at different periods for the 
Greek text, multiple Latin translations from Arabic and from Greek, groupings 
of individual works under familiar medieval titles, and a wide range of 
pseudonymous texts. The descriptions provided by the sources are often 
imprecise, especially as to which Latin translation was recorded. Since the 
sixteenth century scholarly interest has focused on the Greek text rather than 
on versions current in the middle ages. Only in recent decades has 
<i>Aristoteles Latinus</i> attempted to document the Latin versions current at 
different times, but its progress with editions has been slow. Recently
<i>Aristoteles Latinus Database</i> (<i>ALD</i>) has provided complementary material.
Since 1971 a separate series <i>Aristoteles Semito-Latinus</i> has aimed to edit
translations from Arabic. Where neither is not available, one must have 
recourse either to major sixteenth-century printings of Latin (in cases where 
they print the medieval versions) or to the earliest printed editions that may 
themselves have been documented by our sources. The resulting index is 
inevitably uneven. Thanks to Pieter de Leemans for his advice.

[<i>pseud.</i>]
<strong><i>Liber de causis</i>, Latin tr.</strong>
ed. A. Pattin in <i>Tijdschrift voor 
Filosofie</i> 28 (1966) 90&ndash;203; the text is also printed with the edition 
of Aquinas's commentary, ed. H. D. Saffrey (Fribourg/Louvain 1954); 
Thorndike/Kibre 996; <i>PAL</i> 18&ndash;20 (no. 13). The work is largely extracted 
from Proclus's <i>Elementatio theologica</i>, and Albertus Magnus names the
compiler as David Iudaeus. Copies are often said to be accompanied by 
a commentary, `Cum ergo remouet causa secunda uniuersalis', attributed
to Alfarabius and to other writers; these passages are in fact 
demonstrations added by the compiler.
