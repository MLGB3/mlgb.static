K75.1: 
<strong>Aristotle [384&ndash;322 BC]
</strong>

<span class="biblio_block">
L. Minio-Paluello in <i>DSB</i> 1. 267&ndash;81 (on tradition and influence).
  Indexing Aristotle's works presents difficulties at several levels. He
wrote a great deal. The sources provide evidence at different periods for the 
Greek text, multiple Latin translations, groupings of individual works under
familiar medieval titles, and a wide range of pseudonymous texts. The 
descriptions provided by the sources are often imprecise, especially as to
which Latin translation was recorded. Since the sixteenth century scholarly
interest has focused on the Greek text rather than on versions current in the
middle ages. Only in recent decades has <i>Aristoteles Latinus</i> attempted to
document the Latin versions current at different times, but its progress with
editions has been slow. Where <i>AL</i> is not available, one must have recourse
either to major sixteenth-century printings of Latin (where they print the
medieval versions) or to the earliest printed editions that may themselves 
have been documented by our sources. The resulting index is inevitably uneven.

[<i>pseud.</i>]
<strong><i>Liber de causis</i>, Latin tr.</strong>
ed. A. Pattin in <i>Tijdschrift voor 
Filosofie</i> 28 (1966) 90&ndash;203; the text is also printed with the edition 
of Aquinas's commentary, ed. H. D. Saffrey (Fribourg/Louvain 1954); 
Thorndike/Kibre 996; <i>PAL</i> 18&ndash;20 (no. 13). The work is largely extracted 
from Proclus's <i>Elementatio theologica</i>, and Albertus Magnus names the
compiler as David Iudaeus. Copies are often said to be accompanied by 
a commentary, `Cum ergo remouet causa secunda uniuersalis', attributed
to Alfarabius and to other writers; these passages are in fact 
demonstrations added by the compiler.
