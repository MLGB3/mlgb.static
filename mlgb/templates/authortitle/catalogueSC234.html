L. Minio-Paluello in <i>DSB</i> 1. 267&ndash;81 (on tradition and influence).
  Indexing Aristotle's works presents difficulties at several levels. He
wrote a great deal. The sources provide evidence at different periods for the 
Greek text, multiple Latin translations from Arabic and from Greek, groupings 
of individual works under familiar medieval titles, and a wide range of 
pseudonymous texts. The descriptions provided by the sources are often 
imprecise, especially as to which Latin translation was recorded. Since the 
sixteenth century scholarly interest has focused on the Greek text rather than 
on versions current in the middle ages. Only in recent decades has 
<i>Aristoteles Latinus</i> attempted to document the Latin versions current at 
different times, but its progress with editions has been slow. Recently
<i>Aristoteles Latinus Database</i> (<i>ALD</i>) has provided complementary material.
Since 1971 a separate series <i>Aristoteles Semito-Latinus</i> has aimed to edit
translations from Arabic. Where neither is not available, one must have 
recourse either to major sixteenth-century printings of Latin (in cases where 
they print the medieval versions) or to the earliest printed editions that may 
themselves have been documented by our sources. The resulting index is 
inevitably uneven. Thanks to Pieter de Leemans for his advice.
